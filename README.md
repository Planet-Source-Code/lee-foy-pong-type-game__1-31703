### Description

This is a game of Pong, as part of my exercises, the code for moving the ball and paddles, was downloaded from this very site, but I`ve modified it and added a scoring system to the game, I also tried adding sound, but I was unsuccessful with the Path, but everything else, came out good... Although I still have a few more ideas for this game, prefect for a beginner, to learn a little code, Menu bars, Forms... Enjoy!
